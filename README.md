# LGBTQ+ Pride Flag Stickers

![banner image with several pride flags](./static/header-image.png "Pride flag banner")

This repository contains a collection of over 30 graphic assets representing various LGBTQ+ Pride flags.

## Asset Files

### Adobe Illustrator source files

The Illustrator files have been assembled for printing as stickers. Each file has the following characteristics:

- CMYK color space
- artboards measure 3&rsquo; &times; 2&rsquo; (76.2 mm &times; 50.8 mm)
- bleed of &frac18;&rsquo; (3.176 mm) that colors stretch into
- clipping mask to hide bleed
- stripes and bars overlap (reduces export artifacts)

The bleed area is hidden behind a clipping mask by default. The mask should be disabled when printing as stickers. Doing so will help prevent undesired white borders around the cutting line. Sticker printing services that support Illustrator format will provide instructions on preparing masks and bleed specific to their environment.

### Screen image files

Screen display versions are provided in scalable (SVG) and bitmap (PNG) formats. In the SVG files, the contents of the bleed area are present but hidden by the clipping mask. The PNG files are 1,024 pixels wide, and the bleed area is not present.

### Template

The blank template used for the flags is located at the top level of the project as the file `flag-template.ait`.
